	<p>A: Occasionally, the Vitamin Daily e-mails will get blocked or marked as Junk Mail by your e-mail program or company. Please login to your e-mail program (such as Outlook Express, Safari, Hotmail, Gmail or Yahoo Mail) and add dailydose@vitaminv.ca to your e-mail address book, contacts or safe senders list.Hint: If you are still not receiving the e-mails, your Internet Service Provider (ISP) is blocking Vitamin Daily as junk mail. Many providers give you an option to tick &quot;this is not junk&quot; from an e-mail that was sent to your junk mail. If this still has not corrected the problem, it could be that your company or internet service provider has increased its spam filters recently. If this is the case please contact your Internet Service Provider. Hint: You may have reached the limit of emails that your service provider allows. If you suspect this is the case, clean out your junk mail, deleted messages, outbox and old messages in your inbox.</p>
